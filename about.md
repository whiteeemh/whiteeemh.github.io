Marshall Museum was created to show achievements of George C Marshall and the artifacts he came upon during his lifetime. Some of these artifacts include: MARSHALL’S MOTHER’S DRESS, MARSHALL’S GRADUATION GIFT, IBM PLAQUE, QUEEN ELIZABETH II CORONATION MEDAL, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ITEMS, FEATURED COLLECTION – JOHN HERRING COLLECTION, and the ROYAL GOLD-PLATED TYPEWRITER. To build upon the history of George C Marshall, there are many videos and other areas that will enrich you with history that not many people know about George C Marshall.
