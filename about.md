# Ignite CLI

<p align="center">
  :fire: The hottest CLI for React Native: boilerplates, plugins, generators, and more. :fire:
  <br/>
</p>

### Why Ignite CLI?

* **Easily spin up a new React Native app** with best practices built-in
* **No runtime!** This is a developer tool only, not a library you have to depend on and figure out how to upgrade
* **An ever-expanding list of [boilerplates](./BOILERPLATES.md) and [plugins](./PLUGINS.md)** to jump-start your app
* **An amazing [community](http://community.infinite.red)** of other Ignite / React Native developers when you need help
* **Battle tested** and used every day by the developers at Infinite Red and thousands of developers around the world
* **Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux** because not all React Native developers are on one platform
* **Saves an average of two weeks** on your React Native development

And you also get (by default) all of the sweet, sweet goodness of [our default boilerplate, Bowser](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-bowser), or choose [one of many others](./BOILERPLATES.md).

> Ignite saved me a few weeks (if not months) getting started with React Native.
